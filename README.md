## Data

The input data are located in the folder **dataraw**. 
The folder **dataderived** contains some intermediate outputs of the analysis.


## Analysis

The analysis is written in the knitr file **landings.Rnw**. 
For convenience, the compiled output **landings.pdf** (containing both the R code and outputs) is also provided. 
The analysis of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) uses similar codes as the analysis of landings. 
The CPUE data are not provided due to federal confidentiality restrictions.
